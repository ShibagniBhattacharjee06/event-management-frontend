# EventOS – Frontend

EventOS Frontend is the client-side application of a cloud-based Event Management Platform.  
It provides a modern, responsive user interface for browsing events, registering for them, and managing events through an admin dashboard.

The application is built using React and Redux Toolkit and is deployed on AWS using S3 and CloudFront.

## Project Description

The frontend of EventOS focuses on usability, performance, and secure interaction with the backend APIs.  
Users can explore upcoming events, view detailed information, and register seamlessly.
